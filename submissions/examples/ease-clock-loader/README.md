# CSS Customization

Override the default design using CSS custom properties.

```css
.my-clock {
    --clock-size: 80px;

    --clock-face: #faf6ef;

    --clock-hand-hour: #1e293b;
    --clock-hand-minute: #334155;
    --clock-hand-second: #e74c5e;

    --clock-dur-hour: 60s;
    --clock-dur-minute: 20s;
    --clock-dur-second: 10s;
}
```

# How It Works

The loader consists of:

* A circular clock face
* An hour hand
* A minute hand
* A ticking second hand
* A centered pivot

The animation relies entirely on CSS:

* `transform: rotate()`
* `@keyframes`
* `steps(60)` for realistic ticking
* CSS variables for customization

No JavaScript is used.
