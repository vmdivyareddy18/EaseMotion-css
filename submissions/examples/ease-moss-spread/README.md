# Ease Moss Spread Animation

A low-profile surface-creeping transition utility designed to simulate directional cell expansion across localized surface coordinates.

## Features
- **Asymmetric Aspect Creep**: Runs independent horizontal and vertical scale ratios (`scaleX`/`scaleY`) to emulate climbing plant layers.
- **Surface Anchor Profiling**: Configured with a dedicated `transform-origin: bottom center` value to maintain surface line contact during growth.
- **Three Structural Speeds**: Built with `default`, `fast` burst, and slow ambient `slow` options.
