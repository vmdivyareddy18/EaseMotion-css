## What does this do?

It is a full, self-contained marketing site for a fictional culinary school ("Saffron & Sage") that showcases EaseMotion CSS in a real-world education layout — hero, class catalog, chef profiles, kitchen gallery, schedule & pricing table, gift CTA, enrollment form, and footer.

## How is it used?

Open `demo.html` directly in any modern browser. No build step, no CDN, no JavaScript framework — just `demo.html` + `style.css`.

The page is composed entirely of `ease-*` utility classes. A few examples:

```html
<!-- Scroll-revealed card that lifts on hover -->
<article class="ease-card ease-reveal-up ease-hover-lift">
  <h3 class="ease-card-title">Beginner Foundations</h3>
  <p class="ease-card-text">Knife skills, mise en place, stocks and sauces.</p>
</article>

<!-- Staggered scroll reveals using delay classes -->
<div class="ease-reveal-up">First in</div>
<div class="ease-reveal-up ease-reveal-d1">Second in</div>
<div class="ease-reveal-up ease-reveal-d2">Third in</div>

<!-- Nav link with animated underline -->
<a href="#classes" class="ease-nav-link ease-hover-underline">Classes</a>

<!-- Gallery image with zoom-on-hover -->
<div class="ease-gallery-item ease-hover-zoom"></div>
```

A tiny inline `IntersectionObserver` (browser-native, no library) toggles the `is-visible` class on `ease-reveal-up` elements as they scroll into view.

## Why is it useful?

EaseMotion CSS exists to make motion and interaction feel **effortless and consistent** across real-world pages. This submission proves that goal in a content-rich vertical (culinary education) by:

- Demonstrating how a **complete business page** can be assembled using only `ease-*` classes — no custom keyframes, no JS framework.
- Showing **composable patterns** (`ease-reveal-up` + `ease-reveal-d1/d2/d3` for staggered entrance, `ease-hover-lift` + `ease-hover-zoom` for tactile feedback).
- Providing a **realistic copy-paste template** other contributors and users can adapt for any education business — language schools, music academies, coding bootcamps, etc.
- Respecting accessibility with a `prefers-reduced-motion` guard so animations gracefully disable for users who request it.
