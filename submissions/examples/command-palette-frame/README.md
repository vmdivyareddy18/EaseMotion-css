# Animated Command Palette Frame — EaseMotion CSS

An interactive, fluid shell interface layout inspired by Spotlight, Raycast, and VS Code. Handles micro-interactions for input pulsing, modal fading, and list stagger transitions.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is an animation/styling shell wrapper component. Functional string matching data engines, filtering operations, and advanced keyboard routing logic are purposefully omitted to remain framework-agnostic.
