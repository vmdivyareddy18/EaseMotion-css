# Deep-Space Satellite Constellation Telemetry Showcase (Phase #1017)

This directory features a responsive, high-performance telemetry configuration design showcase tracking deep-space constellations. Built entirely out of pure semantic HTML and custom-engineered **EaseMotion CSS** interactions.

## 🚀 How to Launch
As an isolated UI design module, no build steps or bundlers are necessary:
1. Navigate directly into the module path:
   `submissions/examples/deep-space-satellite-constellation-telemetry-phase-1017/`
2. Launch `demo.html` locally using any standard modern browser.

## 🎨 Motion Framework Analysis

### 1. Compositor-Layer Entrance Sequencer
* **Classes:** `.em-fade-in`, `.em-slide-up-1`, `.em-slide-up-2`, `.em-slide-up-3`
* **Mechanics:** Bypasses browser layout-reflow cycles using `translate3d` configurations, ensuring animations load seamlessly at **60fps**.

### 2. Live Orbit Grid Engine
* **Classes:** `.em-spin-clockwise`, `.em-spin-counter`, `.em-orbital-float`
* **Mechanics:** Employs synchronized dual-axis linear infinite rotations on nested vector paths alongside asymmetrical drift keyframes to mirror real-time satellite orbital adjustments.

### 3. UI Transponder Items
* **Classes:** `.em-interactive-slide`
* **Mechanics:** Applies tactile directional translations (`translateX`) with an entry profile mapping to custom cubic-bezier curves for crisp user micro-interactions.
