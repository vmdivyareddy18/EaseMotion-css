# Glassmorphism Profile Card Hover Effect

## Overview

A modern, responsive profile card component featuring a glassmorphism aesthetic with backdrop-filter blur. The card includes a smooth hover lift effect, animated social media icons with platform-specific hover states, and a gradient border glow that appears on hover — all implemented in pure CSS with zero JavaScript.

## Features

* Glassmorphism background using `backdrop-filter: blur(16px)`
* Smooth hover lift with cubic-bezier easing and scale transform
* Gradient border glow on hover via `::before` pseudo-element
* Animated social media icons (GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, Dribbble, Website)
* Platform-specific hover colors for social icons
* Avatar placeholder with gradient initials
* Gradient accent bar at the top of the card
* Background orbs for visual depth
* Responsive flexbox grid layout
* Mobile-optimized breakpoint
* Reduced-motion accessibility support

## Use Cases

* Portfolio websites
* Team member directories
* User profile sections
* About pages
* Landing page testimonials
* Social media link aggregators

## Example Usage

```html
<div class="profile-card">
  <div class="card-accent"></div>
  <div class="avatar-wrap">
    <div class="avatar-placeholder">A</div>
  </div>
  <div class="card-name">Alex Rivera</div>

    <a href="#" class="social-icon linkedin" aria-label="LinkedIn">L</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Animation Behavior

1. Card fades in with a `translateY(20px)` offset on page load.
2. On hover, the card lifts 10px upward with a `scale(1.02)` and a `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` easing.
3. A gradient border glow fades in around the card edges.
4. Social media icons bounce upward with `translateY(-4px) scale(1.1)` on hover.
5. Avatar border color shifts and scales slightly on card hover.
