## Features

- Vertical scroll controls horizontal movement
- Sticky horizontal section

- Responsive design
- Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- No libraries required

## Animation Behavior

### Horizontal Movement

The horizontal track moves according to scroll progress:

```javascript
track.style.transform =
    `translateX(-${progress * moveDistance}px)`;
```

### Card Animation

Cards animate continuously while scrolling:

```javascript
opacity
scale
translateY
```

The card closest to the viewport center receives:

- Highest opacity
- Largest scale
- Lowest vertical offset

## Customization

### Scroll Length

```css
.scroll-section{
    height:500vh;
}
```

Increase for slower horizontal movement.

### Card Gap

```css
gap:40px;
```

### Scale Range

```javascript
scale(0.85 + intensity * 0.15)
```

### Vertical Motion

```javascript
translateY(20 - intensity * 20)
```

### Opacity Range

```javascript
0.4 + intensity * 0.6
```
