# View-Driven Scroll Animations (Scroll-Timeline)

A high-performance, pure CSS layout-motion module designed for **EaseMotion-css**. This feature introduces scroll-linked micro-interactions utilizing modern CSS viewport detection APIs (`view-timeline` and `animation-timeline`). 

It allows elements to seamlessly animate (fade, scale, blur, and translate) into view based purely on the user's scroll depth—eliminating the need for bulky JavaScript intersections libraries like ScrollReveal or GSAP.

## 🔥 Framework Utilities

This feature introduces a core orchestration utility class that can be easily composed with explicit entry animation keyframe styles.

### 1. The Core Scroll Watcher
| Utility Class | Description | CSS Engine |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `.ease-scroll-view` | Binds the element's layout to the browser viewport's vertical scrolling axis. | `animation-timeline: view()` |

### 2. Composable Preset Keyframes
Drop any of these classes alongside `.ease-scroll-view` to configure the explicit entry mechanic:
* `.ease-reveal-dramatic`: Shifts an element upward by `120px` from a slightly scaled down, blurred, and completely submerged opacity state into sharp focus.
* `.ease-reveal-cinematic`: Creates a cinematic 3D tracking depth effect where the element smoothly scales up from `0.7` to its standard size as it commands viewport real estate.

## 🛠️ Usage Example

To apply these native effects, append the controller class and your choice of animation preset directly to the markup structure:

```html
<div class="card ease-scroll-view ease-reveal-dramatic">
  <h3>Smooth Pipeline Reveal</h3>
  <p>This element tracks perfectly with the native scrolling thread.</p>
</div>

<div class="hero-image ease-scroll-view ease-reveal-cinematic">
  <img src="dashboard-preview.png" alt="Analytics Engine UI">
</div>
```
## Architecture & Performance Specs
- Compositor-Thread Execution: Because these animations run directly on modern scroll-driven engine specifications, recalculations do not touch the browser's Main Thread. This prevents layout thrashing, ensures zero frame drops, and runs at a locked 60fps/120fps.

- Zero JS Overhead: Zero event listeners on scroll, no getBoundingClientRect() thrashing, and zero dependencies.

- Safe Technical Fallbacks & Graceful Degradation
To achieve maximum production robustness, the module contains isolated guard rails for legacy environments and system-level parameters:

- Legacy Browsers: Leverages native @supports conditional querying. If a browser does not fully support animation-timeline: view(), styles degrade gracefully back to baseline static positioning (opacity: 1, regular scales) with zero layout shifts.

- Accessibility First: Fully optimized for users with motion sensitivities. Out-of-the-box @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) media query overrides instantly neutralize translation depths, kill scale modifications, and strip animation configurations.

## Testing Matrix & Verification
- Engine Target: Verified functional on Chrome (115+), Edge (115+), and Opera.

- Accessibility Check: Passed accessibility testing via automated system simulation settings (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce).
