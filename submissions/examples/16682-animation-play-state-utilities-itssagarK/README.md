# CSS Animation Play-State Utilities (Issue #16682)

This submission introduces **animation-play-state** utility classes for the **EaseMotion CSS** framework. These utilities enable declarative playback control (play, pause, hover-toggles) of CSS animations.

## 📋 Features & Classes

| Utility Class | CSS Rule | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `.ease-paused` | `animation-play-state: paused !important;` | Pauses any running keyframe animations on the element. |
| `.ease-running` | `animation-play-state: running !important;` | Resumes/runs keyframe animations on the element. |
| `.ease-hover-paused` | `animation-play-state: paused !important` (on hover) | Automatically pauses the animation on mouse/pointer hover. |
| `.ease-hover-running` | `animation-play-state: running !important` (on hover) | Automatically resumes the animation on mouse/pointer hover. |
| `.ease-play-state-paused` | `animation-play-state: paused !important;` | Explicit fallback alias for pausing. |
| `.ease-play-state-running` | `animation-play-state: running !important;` | Explicit fallback alias for running. |

## 🛠️ Usage Example

To pause an infinite marquee or custom rotation on hover, add the `.ease-hover-paused` utility class:

```html
<div class="marquee-track ease-hover-paused">
  <!-- Interactive scrolling items -->
</div>
```

## 🎨 Interactive Demo

The included [demo.html](demo.html) showcases:
1. **Interactive Loader Spinners:** A collection of spinners (spin, scale ripple, bar equalizers) where playback state is toggled dynamically.
2. **Infinite Scrolling Stream:** A horizontal scrolling track that uses `.ease-hover-paused` to pause whenever a pointer hovers over the content.
