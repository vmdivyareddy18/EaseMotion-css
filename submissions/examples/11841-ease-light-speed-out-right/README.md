# Animation: ease-light-speed-out-right

This submission implements the `ease-light-speed-out-right` exit utility GSSOC issue **#11841**.

## Description

The `ease-light-speed-out-right` animation exits an element toward the right at high speed with a skew effect. It rapidly translates the element to `translateX(100%)` while skewing it at `skewX(-30deg)` and fading its opacity to `0` using a fast ease-in curve.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Ending state: `translateX(100%) + skewX(-30deg) + opacity(0)`
- Timing: Fast ease-in curve.
- Focus visible indicators and reduced-motion override included.
