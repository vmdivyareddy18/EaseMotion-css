- Serif typography (`Georgia`) throughout headings, quotes, and eyebrow labels for elegance
- Italic serif used for eyebrows, taglines, quotes, and footer text for editorial flair

- Hover-reveal overlay on portfolio cards (description appears on `:hover`)
- Rose gradient dark footer CTA band (deep rose `#2a1018 → #3d1828`) for dramatic contrast
- ✿ flower motif used as logo mark, list bullets, badge decorators, and CTA accent
- Price feature lists using `✿` content pseudo-element instead of standard checkmarks
- Consistent rose/blush glassmorphism throughout form focus states and stat cards
- Rose gold gradient scrollbar and text selection
