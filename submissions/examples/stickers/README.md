# Sticky Header Component

A high-performance, hardware-accelerated sticky navigation header designed for modern web interfaces. This component utilizes CSS backdrop filters and GPU-accelerated transforms to ensure smooth scrolling without flickering or layout jitter.

## Features

## Technical Details
- **Stack:** Pure CSS, leveraging core variables and utilities from the `EaseMotion` library.
- **Accessibility:** Includes `role="banner"` for the header and `aria-label` for navigation menus.
- **Browser Support:** Optimized for modern browsers supporting backdrop filters; provides graceful degradation.

## Usage
