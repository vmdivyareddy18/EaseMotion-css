# Asset Warranty Status Cards Feature

Submits layout utility architectures and status visualization cards for hardware procurement matrices (`.ease-warranty-grid`, `.ease-warranty-card`, `.ease-warranty-*`) under issue #15366.

## Functional Mechanics

- **The Problem:** Tracking corporate physical hardware assets, data center racks, or company devices across separate deployment environments using vanilla text sheets or boring table displays obscures upcoming warranty expiration milestones. This leads to accidental coverage lapses and costly un-contracted out-of-pocket technical support charges.
- **The Solution:** Highly visible inventory status layout cards. This component isolates hardware details into clean, grid-aligned panels paired with semantic status pills (Active, Expiring Soon, Expired). It empowers procurement specialists and IT sysadmins to quickly prioritize hardware maintenance loops inside internal dashboard consoles.

## Usage Layout Structure
```html
<div class="ease-warranty-grid">
  <div class="ease-warranty-card">
    <div class="ease-warranty-header">
      <div>
        <h5 class="ease-asset-title">Asset Identifier Name</h5>
        <span class="ease-asset-serial">Serial-Or-ID-String</span>
      </div>
      <span class="ease-warranty-badge ease-warranty-active">Active</span>
    </div>
    <div class="ease-warranty-details">
      </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
