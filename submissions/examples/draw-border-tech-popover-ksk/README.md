# Draw-Border Tech Popover (`draw-border-tech-popover-ksk`)

1. What does this do?  
A minimal, monospace-styled popover for API docs and developer tool interfaces. The trigger is a compact `ref` badge that draws a fine border on hover then opens a terminal-style popover with function signatures, parameter tables, and version badges.

2. How is it used?  
Pair `<input class="ease-tech-toggle">` + `.ease-tech-wrap` with a `.ease-tech-trigger` label and `.ease-tech-popover` card. Configure per-instance via CSS custom properties:

```css
.ease-tech-wrap {
  --ease-tech-color:     #4ade80;   /* draw line + accent colour  */
  --ease-tech-duration:  0.4s;
  --ease-tech-thickness: 1.5px;     /* thin = minimalist          */
  --ease-tech-radius:    6px;       /* sharp corners = tech feel  */
  --ease-tech-width:     320px;
  --ease-tech-easing:    cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
  --ease-tech-spring:    cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1);
}
```

3. Why is it useful?  
Provides an inline API reference popover pattern — no page navigation required. The thin draw-border and monospace typography signal "developer tool" while the clip-path animation keeps the interaction feeling modern and intentional. Three colour themes (green, blue, purple) ship ready to use.
