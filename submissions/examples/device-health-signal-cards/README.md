# Device Health Signal Cards Feature

Submits layout utility architectures and responsive data visualization modules for embedded hardware telemetry panels (`.ease-device-grid`, `.ease-device-card`, `.ease-signal-*`) under issue #15326.

## Functional Mechanics

- **The Problem:** Displaying fleet diagnostics, server monitoring metrics, or IoT device health parameters inside simple text rows makes it hard to quickly distinguish functional machines from crashing field units. This increases the mean time to resolution (MTTR) during hardware disruptions.
- **The Solution:** Isolated telemetry status modules. This layout utility configures a scannable grid pattern that stacks device identifiers alongside visual status tags (Excellent, Elevated, Critical) and atomic hardware readouts. It helps operators triage physical infrastructure nodes instantly within monitoring systems.

## Usage Layout Structure
```html
<div class="ease-device-grid">
  <div class="ease-device-card">
    <div class="ease-device-header">
      <div>
        <h5 class="ease-device-title">Device Name</h5>
        <span class="ease-device-id">ID-String</span>
      </div>
      <span class="ease-signal-badge ease-signal-online">● Online</span>
    </div>
    <div class="ease-device-metrics">
      <div class="metric-unit-group">
        <span class="metric-label">Label</span>
        <span class="metric-value">Value</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Closes #15326
