# ease-container-query

Animation utilities that adapt their behavior based on parent container size using CSS Container Queries. Zero JavaScript required.

## Usage

Wrap your component in an ease-cq container, then apply animation classes to children:

    <div class="ease-cq">
      <div class="ease-cq-slide">Adapts to container width</div>
    </div>

## Classes

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| ease-cq | Sets container-type: inline-size on wrapper |
| ease-cq-size | Sets container-type: size on wrapper |
| ease-cq-slide | Slide-up entrance — distance adapts to container width |
| ease-cq-fade | Fade-in entrance — duration adapts to container width |
| ease-cq-zoom | Zoom entrance — intensity adapts to container width |
| ease-cq-layout | Stacks vertically in narrow, row in wide (480px+) |
| ease-cq-text | Font size adapts to container width |
| ease-cq-hide | Hidden in containers under 350px |
| ease-cq-fast | Forces fast animation duration |
| ease-cq-slow | Forces slow animation duration |
| ease-cq-delay-100 | 100ms animation delay |
| ease-cq-delay-200 | 200ms animation delay |
| ease-cq-delay-300 | 300ms animation delay |
| ease-cq-delay-500 | 500ms animation delay |

## Container Breakpoints

| Container Width | Behavior |
|---|---|
| under 400px | Subtle animations (8px slide, fast fade) |
| 400px - 699px | Medium animations (20px slide, normal fade) |
| 700px+ | Full animations (40px slide, slow fade) |

## Browser Support

Requires CSS Container Queries (Chrome 105+, Edge 105+, Firefox 110+, Safari 16+). Falls back gracefully — elements remain visible with base animation in unsupported browsers.

## Notes

- Always apply ease-cq (or ease-cq-size) to the parent wrapper, not the animated element
- Combine with other ease-* utilities freely
- Unlike viewport media queries, container queries respond to the component's own layout context
