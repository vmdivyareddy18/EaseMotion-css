# Deep-Brain Stimulation Neural Tuning Suite (Phase #937)

An isolated, premium medical cybernetics telemetry layout designed to demonstrate standard conformity with the **EaseMotion CSS framework**. This interface utilizes advanced pure-CSS state tracking for high-performance layout manipulation maintaining fluid 60fps animation render rates.

## 🚀 Live Interaction Mechanics
- **Node Selection Matrix:** Clicking any left-hand probe card (`Ventral Striatum`, `Subthalamic`, or `Globus Pallidus`) triggers structural state adjustments. This changes visual asset metrics, alters wave oscillation weights via dynamic CSS runtime variable evaluations (`--em-wave-mod`), and triggers contextual modulation levels in real time.
- **Auto-Sync Toggle:** Toggling the automated pulse state controls live keyframe processing loops. Turning it off immediately halts heavy layout rendering transforms smoothly without triggering reflow bugs.
- **Zero-Dependency Core:** Implemented without JavaScript layers. State conditions are managed entirely using structural pseudo-selectors (`:checked ~ .selector`).

## 🎛️ Architecture Breakdowns

### 1. 60fps Pipeline Rendering Engine
All interface adjustments leverage composition properties (`transform` and `opacity`) rather than structural geometry indicators (`height`, `width`, `margin`) to prevent main thread rendering overhead:
```css
.em-motion-wave-slow {
  will-change: transform;
  transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0); /* Direct GPU Composite Layer Promotion */
  animation: emWaveMotion 12s linear infinite;
}
