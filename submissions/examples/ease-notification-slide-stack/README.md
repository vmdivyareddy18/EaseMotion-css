# ease-notification-slide-stack – Notification Slide Stack

A notification stack where new items slide in from the top while existing items smoothly shift downward using the FLIP technique.

## How it works
- New notifications are prepended to the container with initial opacity: 0 and 	ranslateY(-20px).
- Adding .visible transitions them to full opacity and normal position.
- Before adding a new item, JavaScript records the bounding rectangles of existing items.
- After insertion, it calculates the positional difference and applies an inverse 	ranslateY to each item, then smoothly animates it to zero — this is the FLIP technique.
- Notifications auto‑dismiss after 4 seconds or on close button click.
- The animation respects prefers-reduced-motion.

## How to use
