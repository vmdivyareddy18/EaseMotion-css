# ease-focus-out

An exit animation where an element loses focus by blurring out and fading away.

## Preview

The element transitions from sharp and fully visible to completely blurred and transparent, giving the impression it has gone out of focus.

## Usage

Add the class `ease-focus-out` to any element:

```html
<div class="ease-focus-out">Going out of focus...</div>
```

Or trigger it dynamically via JavaScript:

```js
element.classList.add("ease-focus-out");
```
