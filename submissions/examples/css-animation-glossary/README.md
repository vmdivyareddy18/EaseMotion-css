# 📖 Beginner's Glossary of CSS Animation Terms

This guide outlines the foundational mechanics of CSS animations, mapping raw platform behavior directly to configurable utility variables found within **EaseMotion-css**.

### Core Animation Properties

| Technical Property | Definition | EaseMotion Variable / Override |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Keyframes** | The programmatic sequence markers (from `0%` to `100%`) outlining exactly what styles alter over an explicit duration timeline. | *Handled via core framework helper utilities like `.ease-bounce`.* |
| **Duration** | The absolute timespan it takes for an animation sequence to complete a full cycle from start to finish. Evaluated in seconds (`s`) or milliseconds (`ms`). | `--ease-animation-duration` |
| **Delay** | An optional programmatic time offset specifying the execution window pause before motion triggers actively. | `--ease-animation-delay` |
| **Iteration Count** | The sequence playback quantity configuration. Can accept an absolute integer scale value or play perpetually using the `infinite` flag. | `--ease-animation-iterations` |
| **Timing Function** | The internal progression acceleration profile (easing curve) managing the variance in pacing throughout a singular sequence timeline loop. | `--ease-animation-timing` |
| **Fill Mode** | Dictates state application assignments prior to initial sequence starts (during active delays) or post-sequence expiration execution states. | `--ease-animation-fill` |

### Common Easing Sub-Types

* **`linear`**: Static motion curve lacking variance. Zero acceleration or deceleration shifts.
* **`ease-in`**: Low-speed sequence launch with high-velocity back-end terminal acceleration patterns. 
* **`ease-out`**: Aggressive high-velocity baseline sequence launch transitioning directly into cushioned deceleration curves at termination.
* **`ease-in-out`**: Cushioned structural launch profile accelerating inside the mid-cycle phase and mirroring deceleration attributes right at termination thresholds.
