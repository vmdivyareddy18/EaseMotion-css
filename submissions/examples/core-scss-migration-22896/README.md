# SCSS Modular Architecture Migration (#22896)

This submission addresses **Issue #22896** by completely reorganizing the massive flat `core/` and `components/` CSS directories into a robust, modern SCSS architecture leveraging `@use` and `@forward`!

To ensure strict compliance with the automated PR bot (which rejects any pull request editing core files directly), this entire migration proposal has been bundled within the `submissions/` directory.

## What's Changed
- **Migration Node Script**: Created `scripts/migrate.mjs` which programmatically cloned the root `core/` and `components/` CSS files, converted them to `.scss` partials (e.g. `_buttons.scss`), and organized them inside `/scss/core` and `/scss/components`.
- **Modular Aggregation**: Programmatically generated `_index.scss` files in every subdirectory using `@forward` to group the components perfectly.
- **Build Tooling Update**: Created `scripts/build-scss.mjs` which utilizes Dart Sass (`sass`) to iterate through the SCSS architecture. It compiles:
  1. A monolithic `easemotion.css` root bundle.
  2. Individual minified component chunks under `dist/components/` (e.g. `dist/components/buttons.css`).

## Demo Verification
The `demo.html` is linking to the newly compiled `style.css` (which is the output of the monolithic build), successfully rendering the migrated Cards, Buttons, and Badges SCSS modules.

## Instructions for Maintainer
Since this is an architectural proposal for the entire repository:
1. Review the generated `scss/` folder structure inside this submission.
2. Review the `scripts/build-scss.mjs` build script.
3. If approved, you can securely copy these folders to the root of the repository to instantly finalize the migration!
