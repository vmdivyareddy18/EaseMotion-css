# CHANGELOG.md Generator

## Overview

This example demonstrates an automated **CHANGELOG.md Generator** that creates release notes from merged Pull Request titles and labels. The workflow groups merged PRs into categories such as **Animation**, **Components**, **Bug Fixes**, and **Documentation**, producing a changelog in the **Keep a Changelog** format before every release.

The page serves as a responsive documentation example for the EaseMotion CSS project.
