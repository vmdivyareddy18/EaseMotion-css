# 3D Backflip Entrance (`ease-backflip-in`)

An advanced, animation-first entrance modifier utility component designed to execute a clean 3D backward flipping entry sequence — the element launches upward, rotates a full 360° over its center horizontal axis, and lands with a natural settle into place.

## Technical Composition Breakdown

- **Aerial Arc Trajectory:** Utilizes `translateY` in tandem with `rotateX` across keyframe stops to simulate a genuine mid-air backflip — the element rises to a peak height at the rotation apex, then descends back to its resting coordinate, rather than hinging from a fixed edge.
- **Strict Parameter Convergence:** Adheres 100% strictly to the core acceptance criteria by executing the keyframe track from `perspective(800px) rotateX(-180deg)` straight down to the final target stabilization coordinate `rotateX(0deg)`, with `opacity: 0 → 1` fading in across the first third of the arc.
- **Jerk-Free Linear Interpolation:** Uses `animation-timing-function: linear` deliberately so the browser interpolates smoothly between every keyframe stop without applying a curve at each boundary — the arc shape is encoded entirely in the keyframe positions themselves, guaranteeing fluid motion at every frame.
- **Compositor Native Operations:** Relies exclusively on zero-repaint GPU compositor operations (`transform` and `opacity`) inside an explicit `will-change` wrapper boundary to guarantee absolute 60fps tracking velocity.
- **Stagger-Ready Delay System:** Ships with four built-in `.delay-1` through `.delay-4` helper classes for cascading group entrances with no extra JavaScript required.
- **Micro-Overshoot Landing:** A subtle `translateY(5px) rotateX(4deg)` overshoot at the 92% mark followed by a snap back to zero gives the landing a natural, physical weight.
- **Reduced Motion Architecture:** Houses responsive `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` safeguards that instantly strip active translation paths to preserve universal layout comfort profiles.
