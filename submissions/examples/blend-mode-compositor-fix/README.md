# Sandbox Layout Fix: Mix-Blend-Mode Typography Layer Flattening WebKit Compositor Resolution

## Overview
A high-performance graphic rendering patch for text elements utilizing color-blending rules to completely eliminate font flattening bugs, stop text invisibility errors, and protect sub-pixel color calculation matrices across Apple Safari (WebKit) viewports.

## 📁 Sandbox Configuration Files
* `demo.html` — Self-contained presentation user cockpit hosting animated high-contrast dual-canvas split blocks to check composition layer stability.
* `style.css` — Scoped layout modifier asset layer replacing un-isolated rendering tracks with explicit graphic isolation limits and hardware blend hints linked back to shared tokens.

## 🐛 The Bug Resolved
Previously, deploying color inversion rendering directives (`mix-blend-mode: difference;`) on absolute text headers or custom cursor nodes triggered severe layout breakdown bugs inside Apple Safari. When any underlying layout module activates a hardware-accelerated translation loop or transformation key frame, WebKit splits that moving element off onto an independent GPU compositor layer. This layer bifurcation breaks data pass-through paths, causing the WebKit engine to stall its color channel lookups and completely drop the blending calculations, rendering typography flat or entirely invisible.

## 🛠️ The Solution
The canvas layer stacking context and hardware painting channels are optimized. By forcing an explicit layout composition barrier override configuration rule (`isolation: isolate;`) onto the shared parent container and embedding a strict rendering track hint (`will-change: mix-blend-mode;`) directly into the blended typography node, you forbid WebKit from scattering children across disconnected compositor planes. Colors recalculate seamlessly over moving vectors natively across all viewports without running script code functions.
