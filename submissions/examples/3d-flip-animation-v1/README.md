## 🚀 What's Inside?

Implementing 3D transformations (`perspective`, `transform-style: preserve-3d`, and `backface-visibility`) from scratch is notoriously tricky and cross-browser finicky. 

EaseMotion CSS gives you instant access to hardware-accelerated 3D animations without writing a single line of JavaScript. This module introduces two core patterns:
1. **Interactive Hover Cards:** Classic 3D front/back flip behavior for pricing tiers, team profiles, and feature cards.
2. **Entrance Animations:** High-impact, springy 3D entry states for dynamic UI elements.
