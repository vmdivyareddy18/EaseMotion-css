# ease-form-step-transition – Multi‑Step Form Transitions

A CSS‑driven multi‑step form with directional transitions: forward steps slide in from the right while fading in, and backward steps slide in from the left.

## How it works
- Hidden radio inputs track the current step.
- Each step panel is absolutely positioned and hidden. When its radio is selected, it becomes visible and slides into view.
- Forward transitions use 	ranslateX(30px) → 0, backward transitions use 	ranslateX(-30px) → 0.
- Step dots at the top indicate progress and are clickable.
- All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion.
