# ease-glassmorphism-contact-form – Glassmorphism Contact Form

A modern contact form with a frosted glass effect (backdrop‑filter) and floating labels. Built with pure CSS and enhanced by EaseMotion utility classes.

## How it works
- The form card uses a semi‑transparent background and ackdrop-filter: blur() to create the glass effect.
- Each input field has a corresponding label that floats above the input when focused or filled (pure CSS using :focus and :not(:placeholder-shown) selectors).
- The colorful gradient background makes the glass effect stand out.
- All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion.
