# Expand Text Hover

A lightweight and smooth text hover animation built using pure CSS.  
When the user hovers over the text, it slightly enlarges and increases the spacing between letters, creating a clean expand effect.

Add the class to any text element:

```

## 🎨 CSS

```css
.expand-text-hover {
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 3rem;
  font-weight: bold;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease, letter-spacing 0.3s ease;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.expand-text-hover:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
  letter-spacing: 4px;
}
```

## 💡 How It Works

- `transform: scale(1.1)` enlarges the text slightly
- `letter-spacing` creates the expanding effect
- `transition` ensures smooth animation
