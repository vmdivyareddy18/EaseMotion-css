# Bean&Box — Specialty Coffee Subscription

A full-page, fully responsive e-commerce landing page designed for a curated specialty coffee subscription service. Built exclusively utilizing the `EaseMotion` CSS utility class architecture to deliver a warm, artisanal, and highly premium aesthetic.

## ☕ Theme & Aesthetic
**Warm Artisan Coffee:**
* **Colors:** Rich Espresso (`#8B4513`), Crema/Warm Off-White (`#FDFBF7`), Pure White (`#FFFFFF`), and Oat Milk/Latte (`#F4EBE1`).
* **Typography:** `Fraunces` (an elegant, old-style serif providing a crafted, editorial feel) paired with `Inter` (a highly legible sans-serif for UI elements and body copy).
* **Vibe:** Crafted, organic, premium, and inviting.

## 🚀 How to Run
This template requires **zero build steps**. 
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure `demo.html` and `style.css` are in the same directory.
3. Open `demo.html` directly in your favorite web browser.

## 🛠️ EaseMotion Classes Showcased
This project relies on the core EaseMotion CSS utility framework to build elegant layouts and micro-interactions without writing custom CSS logic in the HTML.

### Layout & Structure
* `ease-container`
* `ease-flex`, `ease-grid`
* `ease-grid-cols-2`, `ease-grid-cols-3`, `ease-grid-cols-4`
* `ease-gap-4`, `ease-gap-6`, `ease-gap-8`, `ease-gap-12`
* `ease-items-center`, `ease-justify-between`, `ease-justify-center`

### Theming Utilities
* `ease-bg-main`, `ease-bg-surface`, `ease-bg-primary`, `ease-bg-light`
* `ease-text-main`, `ease-text-primary`, `ease-text-white`, `ease-text-muted`
* `ease-border`, `ease-border-y`
* `ease-font-bold`, `ease-font-display`, `ease-font-display-italic`

### Animations & Scroll Reveals
* `ease-reveal`, `ease-reveal-up`, `ease-reveal-scale` (Intersection Observer triggered for smooth scroll-in)
* `ease-fade-in`, `ease-slide-up`, `ease-bounce-in` (Initial page load transitions)
* `ease-delay-100` through `ease-delay-500` (Staggered element loading)

### Micro-Interactions (Hover)
* `ease-hover-lift` (Y-axis translation + shadow expansion for buttons and roaster cards)
* `ease-hover-scale` (Scaling for pricing tiers and brew guides to emphasize value)
* `ease-hover-fade` (Subtle opacity shift on logos)
* `ease-hover-underline` (Animated bottom border on navigation links)

## 📱 Responsiveness
The layout seamlessly adapts across devices. Desktop 3-column roaster grids, 4-column grind options, and pricing tables smoothly degrade to a centralized, single-column design on mobile devices. Font sizes utilize CSS `clamp()` to scale perfectly across viewports without breaking the artisanal layout.
