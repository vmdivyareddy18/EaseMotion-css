# Sandbox Layout Fix: 3D Transform Perspective Rotation Card Box-Shadow Flattening Resolution

## Overview
A high-performance structural rendering patch for 3D transforming components to completely restore peripheral drop shadows, stop compositor mask truncation flaws, and protect element depth maps during interactive rotation steps.

## 📁 Sandbox Configuration Files
* `demo.html` — Self-contained user cockpit hosting interactive perspective tilt cards to validate layer composition alpha paths.
* `style.css` — Scoped layout modifier asset layer shifting shadow calculations from absolute transforming blocks over onto flat parent layer graphic filters linked back to global core tokens.

## 🐛 The Bug Resolved
Previously, combining soft drop shadows (`box-shadow`) with high-fidelity 3D hover rotation metrics (`transform: perspective() rotateX()`) on a single card component triggered critical rendering defects inside Google Chrome and Apple Safari. When the 3D rotation transform initiates, the layout engine splits the card off onto an isolated hardware GPU composition layer. Because standard box shadows are bound to flat 2D bounding parameters, the browser's compositor thread drops or flattens the shadow matrix entirely, causing it to clip away and break element depth definitions.

## 🛠️ The Solution
The box model stacking and element composition channels are optimized. By stripping out dead `box-shadow` properties and nesting the 3D transforming child card inside an explicit flat parent shield wrapper assigned with a graphic filter rule (`filter: drop-shadow(...);`), you isolate depth calculations away from spatial layer transformations. Shadows map fluidly matching alpha profiles natively across all breakpoints without using calculation scripts.
