## How it works
- On button click, JavaScript adds .badge-unlocked to the badge wrapper.
- The wrapper transitions from scale(0) rotate(-15deg) to scale(1) rotate(0deg) (swing-in).
- The emoji bounces in with a slight delay.
- A concentric glow ring expands and fades out.
- Title and subtitle fade in last.
- All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion.
