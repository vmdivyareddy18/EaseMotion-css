# Dot-Only Minimal Badge Variant

An isolated component submission expanding notification badge tracking utilities. Introduces the standalone `.ease-badge-dot` asset class to drive minimalist, high-density signaling points natively without requiring text padding footprints.

## Utility Roster API

- `.ease-badge-dot`: Sets the standard 1:1 aspect ratio (`8px` circular footprint). Serves as a neutral structural element anchor.
- `.ease-badge-dot-primary`: Maps a bright Blue color backing. Ideal for identifying incoming communication threads, system updates, or new user messages.
- `.ease-badge-dot-success`: Maps a standard Green color backing. Signals healthy processing environments, online connection layers, or completed task tasks.
- `.ease-badge-dot-warning`: Maps an interactive Amber color backing. Signals system performance limits, data synch lag, or pending permission states.
- `.ease-badge-dot-danger`: Maps a high-visibility Red color backing. Calls attention to structural runtime exceptions, offline gateways, or critical error paths.

## Usage Layout Structure
```html

<div class="user-profile">
  <span class="ease-badge-dot ease-badge-dot-success"></span>
  <span>Active Administrator</span>
</div>
```
