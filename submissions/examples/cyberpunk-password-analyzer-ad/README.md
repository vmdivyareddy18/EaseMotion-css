# Cyberpunk Interactive Password Strength Analyzer Field

## 1. What does this do?
This submission implements a security password input field featuring cyberpunk aesthetics. It contains an interactive text field with status terminal diagnostics and a segmented block strength meter that charges block-by-block with glowing colors (Red/Critical, Yellow/Weak, Cyan/Secure) as the password complexity increases.

## 2. How is it used?
Developers can use this component by placing the `.cyber-pass-card` chassis block into their form structures:

```html
<div class="cyber-pass-card">
  <div class="input-container">
    <input type="password" class="cyber-pass-input">
    <div class="status-terminal">SYS_STATUS: WAITING_</div>
  </div>
  <div class="strength-indicator">
    <div class="strength-bar">
      <div class="bar-block"></div>
      <div class="bar-block"></div>
      <div class="bar-block"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## 3. Why is this useful?
It provides an advanced form layout demonstration showing:
- **Interactive Form Indicators:** Combines dynamic JS logic with pure CSS variables to alter container glows and border colors depending on the complexity score.
- **Segmented Block Alignment:** Employs transitioning segmented indicator blocks that expand neon glow animations without causing browser layout shifts.
- **Micro-interactivity:** Integrates focus state transformations on input text blocks and status indicators.
