## How it works
- The loader is a container with a CSS spinner and a “Loading more…” message.
- It is hidden by default (opacity: 0, isibility: hidden). JavaScript adds the .show class to fade it in.
- A “Load More” button simulates fetching new items. After a short delay, new list items are appended and the loader fades out.
- A scroll listener also triggers loading when the button is near the viewport.
- When no more pages are available, the loader disappears and an end‑of‑list message appears.
- The animation respects prefers-reduced-motion.
