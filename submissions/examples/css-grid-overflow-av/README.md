# CSS Grid Child `min-width: 0` Architecture

## What does this do?
Proposes a massive, framework-wide layout stability refactor to aggressively eradicate catastrophic nested CSS Grid overflow bugs. By explicitly enforcing `min-width: 0;` across all grid and flexbox children, we completely prevent unbroken strings of text (like extremely long URLs or massive base64 images) from violently blowing out the framework's grid containers and causing ugly horizontal scrollbars.

## How is it used?
Maintainers and core contributors must systematically audit all grid and flexbox container children across the entire repository—specifically targeting `components/grid.css`, `components/cards.css`, and `components/forms.css` (spanning 10+ core files).

Currently, developers are violently neglecting a highly dangerous native CSS Grid rendering behavior. By default, a grid item's minimum width is mathematically calculated as `auto` instead of `0`:
```css
/* ❌ BAD: Dangerously allows content to destroy the grid layout */
.ease-grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;
}
.ease-grid-content {
  /* Missing constraint! */
}
```

This incredibly toxic legacy approach must be entirely ripped out. Every single grid child must explicitly declare `min-width: 0;` (or `min-height: 0;` for column grids):
```css
/* ✅ GOOD: Perfect mathematical grid constraints */
.ease-grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;
}
.ease-grid-content {
  min-width: 0; /* Violently forces the child to strictly obey parent tracks! */
}
```

## Why is it useful?
Currently, EaseMotion is actively destroying downstream enterprise applications due to catastrophic grid blowouts. Because the framework dangerously relies on the native `min-width: auto` default, when an enterprise developer dynamically injects user-generated content into an `.ease-card` (like an extremely long, unbroken Wikipedia URL or a massive SHA-256 hash code), the text violently ignores `text-overflow: ellipsis;`. It physically forces the entire grid child to expand beyond its designated column, completely destroying the parent layout, violently pushing surrounding elements off the screen, and forcing an incredibly ugly horizontal scrollbar across the entire browser viewport.

By aggressively forcing every single grid child component across all 10+ framework files to strictly utilize `min-width: 0;`, we completely eradicate this catastrophic layout vulnerability natively. The grid child mathematically overrides the browser's dangerous `auto` sizing, strictly forcing the content to shrink and truncate gracefully. This physically guarantees perfectly responsive, completely bulletproof enterprise layouts that can flawlessly handle absolutely any dynamically injected user data without ever breaking the CSS grid.
