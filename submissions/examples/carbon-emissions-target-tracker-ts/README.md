# Carbon Emissions Target Tracker

## Overview

A dashboard component for tracking carbon emissions against reduction targets. Displays current emissions, target emissions, and reduction achieved via progress bars, summary cards, and three distinct state cards (on-track, attention-needed, off-track) — all in pure CSS with zero JavaScript.

## Features

* Summary cards for current emissions, target, and reduction achieved
* Animated progress bars for emissions, target, and reduction metrics
* Three target state cards with visual and text-based status indicators
* Color-coded accents (green/yellow/red) plus icon badges for accessibility
* Status text labels so meaning is clear without relying on color alone
* Staggered fade-up entrance animations
* Dark theme with glassmorphism surfaces
* Fully responsive layout
* Reduced-motion accessibility support

## Use Cases

* Sustainability dashboards
* ESG reporting interfaces
* Corporate carbon footprint trackers
* Environmental impact monitoring

## Example Usage

```html
<div class="state-card on-track">
  <div class="badge">On Track</div>
  <div class="title">Regional Office</div>
  <div class="desc">Emissions are 18% below target.</div>
  <div class="metric">
    <span class="m-label">Current</span>
    <span class="m-value">410 tCO₂</span>
  </div>
  <div class="metric">
    <span class="m-label">Target</span>
    <span class="m-value">500 tCO₂</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

## State Indicators

| Off Track | Red (#ef4444) | "Off Track" | ✗ |

## Accessibility

Status is conveyed through both color and text labels (badge text + icon). The component respects `prefers-reduced-motion` to disable all animations.
