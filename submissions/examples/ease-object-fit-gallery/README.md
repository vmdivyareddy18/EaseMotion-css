# CSS Object-Fit Gallery (`ease-object-fit-gallery`)

A responsive image gallery demonstrating the power of `object-fit: cover` paired with pure CSS hover animations.

## 🚀 Features & EaseMotion Showcase

- **Object-Fit Cover**: Automatically crops and scales images to fill their grid containers flawlessly without aspect-ratio distortion.
- **CSS Grid Integration**: Works beautifully with CSS grid, including spanning rows and columns.
- **Hover Animations**: Includes smooth image scaling (`transform: scale`) and an animated gradient overlay that fades and slides up.
- **Zero JS**: Completely CSS-driven structure and interactivity.
