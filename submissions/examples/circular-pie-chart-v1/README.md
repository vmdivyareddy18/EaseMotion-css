# Sandbox Component Showcase: Pure-CSS Interactive Asset-Independent Circular Pie Chart Data Wheel

## Overview
A zero-dependency, pure-CSS interactive asset-independent pie chart data wheel and data telemetry visualization widget component isolated within an examples subdirectory. It coordinates horizontal segmentation transforms, vector thickness inflations, and text summary tooltip updates natively via inline SVG circle nodes assigned with stroke dash properties, running fluid navigation loops without loading external script dependencies.

## 📁 Sandbox Configuration Files
* `demo.html` — Self-contained user layout cockpit hosting stroke-dash circle elements, heading strings, and absolute text tooltip readouts.
* `style.css` — Scoped layout sheet establishing isolated hardware transform origins and percentage offset mathematical calculations linked back to core design tokens.

## 🚀 Key Layout Mechanics
1. **Mathematical Stroke Dash Routing:** Overcomes the need for Canvas pixel-repainting or script drawing loops by constructing data sectors using inline SVG geometric `<circle>` elements. By fixing the circles' radius metric to `16px`, the system establishes a total path boundary circumference of `100.53px` (2 * π * 16). Assigning percentage values straight to the `stroke-dasharray` and cascading clockwise displacements via `stroke-dashoffset` maps clean pie shares natively.
2. **Parent Sibling Text Interception:** Eliminates the necessity for performance-heavy hover click handlers or mutation observers by grouping the data nodes before the card text wells. Moving a cursor across a vector slice natively calls downstream sibling selectors: `#pt-ai:hover ~ .alm-chart-tooltip-card #tooltip-row-ai`. Mismatched default readouts dissolve away while the corresponding category information box fades into place.
3. **GPU-Accelerated Sector Inflation:** Refactors active row adjustments away from layout padding mutations, inflating vector thicknesses directly via hardware-optimized scales (`transform: scale(1.04);`). Because transformation coordinates lock securely around a central vector origin point (`transform-origin: 32px 32px;`), selected segments swell symmetrically without causing expensive document container reflow loops.
4. **Sandbox Compliance Safeguard:** Fully satisfies repository security policies by placing every asset line strictly inside `submissions/examples/circular-pie-chart/`.
