# animation-fill-mode-tm

## What does this do?
Adds utility classes to control the animation-fill-mode CSS property for managing element styles before and after animations.

## How is it used?
<div class="fill-forwards">Stays visible after animation ends</div>
<div class="fill-backwards">Applies first keyframe before animation starts</div>
<div class="fill-both">Applies both forwards and backwards rules</div>
<div class="fill-none">No fill mode applied</div>

## Why is it useful?
These utilities let developers control what styles persist before and after an animation completes, filling a notable gap in EaseMotion's animation utility suite without writing custom CSS.
