# ease-leaves-fall – Autumn Leaves Falling

A seasonal animation: leaf‑shaped elements drift downward with rotation and horizontal sway, simulating autumn leaves falling. Great for nature‑themed pages, seasonal decorations, or ambient background effects.

## How it works
- JavaScript injects leaf emojis at random horizontal positions with custom properties for fall duration, sway distance, and rotation.
- The @keyframes leaf-fall animates 	ranslateY from top to bottom, while 	ranslateX oscillates left/right using the custom property --sway-distance, and otate turns the leaf gradually.
- Each leaf has a random speed and drift, creating a natural, varied look.
- Leaves are removed from the DOM after their animation ends to avoid memory buildup.
- The animation respects prefers-reduced-motion.

## How to use
