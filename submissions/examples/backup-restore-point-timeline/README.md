# Backup Restore Point Timeline Feature

Submits layout utility architectures and component timeline configurations for historical server snapshot structures (`.ease-timeline-container`, `.ease-timeline-node`) under issue #15329.

## Functional Mechanics

- **The Problem:** Presenting historical data storage snapshots, database backups, or deployment check-ins using simple drop-down blocks or tabular rows hides the chronological context. This increases the danger of operators selecting a corrupted or out-of-order system image during high-stress recovery windows.
- **The Solution:** Chronological linear progress columns. This feature delivers atomic layout segments that position sequential event entries alongside pseudo-element tracking lines and colored context bullets (Active, Stable, Legacy). This configuration lets sysadmins track version pathways and manage rollbacks safely inside infrastructure management modules.

## Usage Layout Structure
```html
<div class="ease-timeline-container">
  <div class="ease-timeline-node latest">
    </div>
</div>
```

Closes #15329
