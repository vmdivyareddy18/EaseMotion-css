# CSS Chip States Visual Feedback

This demo details accessibility and visual enhancements for the selected and disabled states of `.ease-chip` controls.

## The Visual Gap

In basic stylesheet settings, selected chips have minimal contrast variations, making them difficult to distinguish from standard state chips. 

Disabled chips also lack clear signals—they have fixed color profiles, keep default pointer cursors, and trigger interactive states, which leads to layout confusion.

## Enhanced State Solutions

This submission enhances state indicators:

1. **Selected State (`.selected`)**:
   - Applies an active checkmark icon (`✓`) using CSS `::before` pseudo-elements.
   - Boosts border colors to purple (`#a78bfa`) and adds a soft background glow.

2. **Disabled State (`.disabled`)**:
   - Reduces opacity to `0.45` to make it appear dimmed.
   - Applies `filter: grayscale(1)` to strip colored indicators.
   - Sets `cursor: not-allowed` and blocks mouse interactions via `pointer-events: none`.

## Verification Steps

1. Open `demo.html` in a web browser.
2. In the **Enhanced Chip States** card:
   - Click on the standard chips under "Standard Tags". Verify they switch to `selected` status with a checkmark and glowing border.
   - Hover over the chips under "Disabled States". Verify the cursor updates to `not-allowed` and clicking has no effect.
3. Compare the visual layout side-by-side with the "Traditional Chip States" column.
