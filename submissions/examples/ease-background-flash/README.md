# Background Flash Animation (`ease-background-flash`)

A beginner-to-intermediate micro-interaction utility component engineered to briefly flash an element’s background to a distinct highlight shade upon operational notifications or state updates before fading back smoothly.

## Architectural Layout Blueprint

- **Custom Variable Binding:** Governed completely via the core `--ease-bg-flash-color` custom layout token property, enabling modular color palette overwrites from downstream styles.
- **Strict Trajectory Pacing:** Operates inside a strict `0.4s` window block, firing the dynamic backdrop highlight state instantly before resolving a smooth decay transition down to baseline coordinates.
- **Accessible Motion Controls:** Outfitted with robust `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` structures that completely bypass transient visual pulses to protect sensory-sensitive users.

## Workspace Tree Map
- `demo.html`: Independent playground housing live manual triggers.
- `style.css`: Clean modular tracking stylesheet rules.
