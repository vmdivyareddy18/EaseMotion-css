# Accordion with Icon

A smooth-animating, accessible accordion component built with pure CSS and HTML `<details>`/`<summary>` elements. It features support for leading icons and a clean interactive caret.

## 1. What does this do?
Provides a collapsible content container (accordion) that supports leading icons in the header. It uses a CSS grid-based animation technique to achieve smooth height transitions without knowing the exact content height.

## 2. How is it used?
The component follows a semantic HTML structure:

```html
<details class="accordion-item">
    <summary class="accordion-header">
        <div class="accordion-header-content">
            <!-- Leading Icon -->
            <svg class="accordion-icon">...</svg>
            <span>Title</span>
        </div>
        <!-- Caret Icon -->
        <svg class="accordion-caret">...</svg>
    </summary>
    <div class="accordion-wrapper">
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <div class="accordion-body">
                Content goes here...
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</details>
```

## 3. Why is it useful?
Accordions are essential for managing large amounts of content in a limited space. Adding icon support improves visual hierarchy and helps users quickly identify the category or purpose of each section. The pure CSS implementation ensures zero dependencies and high performance.
